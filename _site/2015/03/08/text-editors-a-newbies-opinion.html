        <section class="post-content">
            <p>Ah yes, the text editor. Dare I say, your number one companion as a coder? As a new web developer, (in the game for 2 months), I&#8217;d like to share my opinion on the four text editor&#8217;s I have tried. This is not intended to be an endorsement, simply just my observations on the four I have used. So here we go&#8230;.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h5><a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">#1. Sublime Text.</a> </h5>
<p>   Right out of the gate, I will start off by saying Sublime is the #1 used and the go-to text editor for the majority of programmers. It simply gets the job done. I have yet to hear of any of my peers having an issue or bug with it. A key component to the success of Sublime is it&#8217;s large fan base and community of users. These users have made thousands of plugins and themes to completely customize your Sublime experience. And did I mention Sublime just works? Yes. It is as stable and reliable as can be. </p>
<p><br /></p>
<h5><a href="http://brackets.io/">#2. Brackets</a></h5>
<p>  Brackets is made by Adobe, the brains behind the ever-so popular Photoshop suite. That alone may give you and idea of what this text editor is geared towards. Brackets has amazing design and front-end capabilities. It comes with a live preview feature that shows you a preview of the page you are building while you are creating it. This editor has huge support for Photoshop. It has a feature called Extract that gives you design info from imported PSD files including colors, fonts, gradients, and measurement information. How cool is that?</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h5><a href="http://lighttable.com/">#3. Light Table</a></h5>
<p>   Light Table touts itself as the &#8220;next generation code editor&#8221;. This is a pretty bold statement, and it may very well be true. However, I feel as though I was unable to tap into it&#8217;s full potential. One of the main features of Light Table is to be able to evaluate your code while you are typing it. This sounds pretty neat, but I was unable to get this feature to work correctly. I fear this code editor maybe isn&#8217;t too newbie friendly or I was just doing something wrong. I will say however,  I much prefer the aesthetic of this editor. The minimal, lightweight design is beautiful. </p>
<p><br /></p>
<h5><a href="https://atom.io/">#4. Atom</a></h5>
<p>   Atom is currently my text editor of choice. It&#8217;s made by the fine folks at <a href="http://www.github.com">Github</a>, and is backed by a growing community. Atom looks similar to Sublime from the start and has the same amount of reliability. Also, it&#8217;s updated religiously. I would say once a week. They have a team that is constantly finding bugs and ways to improve the application. That&#8217;s something I love and support. Atom is extremely customizable and I love it&#8217;s easy to understand user interface. You can search for new plugins and themes very easily, and see what plugins and themes have been downloaded the most/are the most popular. </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>   So there you have it, my two cents. I will continue to play around with all of these editors and report back if I have new substantial findings. I have no doubt new editors will come out as well. But, for now, Atom has my attention!</p>
