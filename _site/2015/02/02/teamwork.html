            <p>"It takes teamwork to make the dream work." </p><p>I apologize. That is a terribly cheesy quote. However, there is so much truth in it. </p><p><br/></p><p>This past weekend I worked on my first group project as a front-end web developer.  I worked on a three person team with a fellow front-ender as well as a back-end, ruby on rails student. Our project was to create a chat application that would post messages to a server, and pull them back down in a chat room on the web page. </p><p><br/></p><p>The project was very fun to work on. It felt like what I imagine working as a front-end developer is really like. We created a workflow, made user stories, and mapped out what we wanted to create as a team. We had meetings 4 days in a row and discussed the progress we had made each day. </p><p><br/></p><p>It was amazing to see how the things we have learned on the front-end, partner with what the back-enders are learning. Also, collaborating with my fellow front-end developer was great. We were able to bounce ideas off of each other and come up with even better ideas than we would have had on our own.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>There were a few unexpected challenges, though. Mainly with using github and keeping our files organized. We had not yet mastered the art of keeping our information in sync whilst working on the same project and some files had to be re-created. </p><p><br/></p><p>All in all, it was a great experience and I saw growth in myself and my peers this weekend. I have honestly missed collaborating in a professional setting such as this. Some of my previous jobs were heavy on it. I think group projects are very valuable for the end product as well as those working on the project. </p>
