title: A Code School Graduate

I graduated from [The Iron Yard] [iron-yard] code school last Friday! It's been a wild, exhausting ride. I'm very thankful for the new knowledge and relationships I have acquired during this program. 

If you're not familiar, [The Iron Yard] [iron-yard] is a three-month intensive coding school. I was lucky enough to attend their first ever front-end engineering class here in Austin, TX. Attending a code school and graduating has been one of the toughest challenges of my life. Staying up very late almost every night of the week, and cramming as much information in my head as possible on a day to day basis. Now that it's over, besides all of the fun web development tools I know how to use and implement, I have a new found love for working and my overall work ethic has improved. I truly enjoy my new life and new set of skills. It's very enriching to know that when I have ideas, I can actually implement them. 

So what's next, you ask? Well, I'm officially on the job hunt. I am looking for a place to work that does exciting stuff but also has plenty of senior level developers that can mentor me on the way. I am confident I will find a place that is the perfect fit.
