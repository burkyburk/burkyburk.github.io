My wife and I are going to Europe in a few weeks! I'm beyond excited and a tad overwhelmed. We bought the tickets back in October, before I knew I would be attending code school. And since I have been studying and coding for the last 4 months, I haven't planned the trip at all! <br><br>

We are flying into London and then taking the chunnel to Paris. A week in each city. This will be our first time overseas, ever. My wife actually had to get her passport. <br><br>

So the last couple of days I have been searching the web for cool places to check out while we are there. When we travel, we don't typically do the "touristy" stuff. I mean, we want to see the Eiffel Tower, but we don't care about climbing it, yknow? We are both big Anthony Bourdain fans and we love the way he travels. He likes to do what the locals in the area do. This is going to be our approach as well.<br><br>

If you have been to London or Paris, or have any recommendations for what we should do/see/eat/drink, I would love to hear it. Please hit me up on Twitter: @burkyburk.
