<p>The past month I have been attending code school at <a href="http://www.theironyard.com">The Iron Yard</a>. This has been one of the most exciting times of my life so far. I am learning something completely new, being subjected to tons of new ideas and web languages. It is extremely exciting to get up in the morning and go to school everyday.Â </p><p><br/></p><p>However, the learning does not always come easy, and there are always challenges involved. (For me, at least.)</p><p><br/></p><p>Coding school is very intensive and requires a very meticulous and thought-out schedule. Especially for myself, being married and all. Finding time to spend with my wife has been difficult, but we knew this going in. And she is very supportive of this new chapter in my life, which is great! Also, sleep. Did I mention sleep? I cherish it.</p>
